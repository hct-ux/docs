Loqate services can be accessed securely over HTTPS. A variety of data formats can be returned, including JSON, XML and CSV, using the various endpoint options that are available (please note that we do not support API connections that use HTTP or a TLS protocol below version 1.2).

## Base URL

Each API has a base URL on which the required data endpoint can be appended, such as json3.ws or xmle.ws. For SOAP, use wsdlnew.ws. See the Endpoints section within each API for a full list of data options.

## Authentication

APIs require authentication in the form of a key, which can be created by adding a service in your account. Each key has its own security settings (URL & IP restriction, usage limits), and as many keys as necessary can be set up with these restrictions. See the [Creating API Keys page](/loqate-basics/creating-api-keys/) for more information. A key must be passed to the API as a parameter in order for the request to authenticate, otherwise an error will be returned.

## Common errors

Each API has specific errors that may be returned, as well as a common set of errors relating to either account or key settings. See the [Common errors page](/api-reference/common-errors) for details.
