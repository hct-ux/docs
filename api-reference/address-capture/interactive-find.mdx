Note this does not return formatted addresses, and repeated calls to this service may be required to drill-down through results until an address ID is returned. The address ID should then be passed into the Retrieve service to obtain a fully formatted address.

**This method does not consume credit.**

Note: we donâ€™t support API connections using HTTP - all calls should use HTTPS.
