- Here you will be presented with a code snippet. Copy this, as you'll need to use it later.  

- Click the "Generate my mappings" button at the bottom of the page. This will generate mappings that match the standard BigCommerce field layout. 

- Next, log in to BigCommerce and go to **Script Manager**. You can access this by clicking Sidebar > Storefront > Script Manager.
