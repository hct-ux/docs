## Overview

Our address capture solution is a simple way to ensure that your users enter accurate address information.

## How it works

The solution consists of two steps, the ```find``` step and the ```retrieve``` step.

First, in the ```find``` step multiple address suggestions are returned based on the user's input. The ```retrieve``` step is used to return the fully formatted address.

Usually this takes the form of a field or fields in which the end user types their search term, and a list of suggestions is returned. The user then selects the correct address from the list, and the fully formatted address is populated into the UI.

<Note>If you have chosen to implement the user flow yourself using our APIs we reccomend firing a ```find``` request for every keystroke from your User.</Note>
