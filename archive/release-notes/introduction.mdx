  The setup wizard for the Local API can be obtained from our SFTP server. Please contact your account manager to retrieve the SFTP information. If you do not know who your account manager is, please contact the support team at support@loqate.com.

<Note>Note: If you are using the command line to connect to the SFTP server, you will need to use 'sftp user@site' format instead of just 'sftp site'.</Note>

The 2025Q1.0 Major Release makes improvements and fixes to the verification process
and the quality of the results. These enhancements are tied to both the data and
the API so please update both.

Loqate has resolved several data related support cases as part of this release and details can be found in the Data Release Notes.

<Info>In the 2024Q4.1 release we updated the Java version required by our Installation manager. Please [review the instructions](https://support.loqate.com/installers/data-installation-and-update-process/) if required.</Info>
