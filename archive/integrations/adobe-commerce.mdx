### Address Verify

The Address Quality Index (AQI) is a score that indicates the quality of the address. Where an address falls below this quality bar, the address is considered invalid, and the user will be prompted. Options are:

- Excellent - A - Verifiable to at last premise level without changes 
- Good - B - Verifiable to at least thoroughfare level with minor changes 
- Average - C - Verifiable to at least locality level with moderate changes 
- Poor - D - Only verifiable to at least locality level with more than moderate changes 
- Bad - E (or empty) - If an address is unable to be parsed, the AQI can be empty
