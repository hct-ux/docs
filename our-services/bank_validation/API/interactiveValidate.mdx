# Request parameters

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in your account.

**Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember to make the request as secure as possible.**

$$*$$ = required field

| Name       | Type       | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Key*       | String     | The key to use to authenticate with the service. For example: "AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11". |
| AccountNumber* | String | The bank account number to validate. |
| SortCode* | String | The branch sort code for the account number. |

## Example request

```JSON 
https://api.addressy.com/BankAccountValidation/Interactive/Validate/v2.00/json3.ws?Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&AccountNumber=12345678&SortCode=00-00-99
```

# Response

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an [error table](https://www.loqate.com/developers/api/bankaccountvalidation/interactive/validate/2/).

| Name       | Type       | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| IsCorrect     | Boolean     | Indicates whether the account number and sort code are valid. |
| IsDirectDebitCapable | Boolean | Indicates whether the account can accept direct debits. Certain accounts (e.g. savings) will not accept direct debits. |
| StatusInformation | String | More detail about the outcome of the validation process. Describes reasons validation failed or changes made to pass validation. DetailsChanged indicates that the account and sortcode should be changed for BACs submission (check CorrectedAccountNumber and CorrectedSortCode). CautiousOK is set where the sortcode exists but no validation rules are set for the bank (very rare). |
| CorrectedSortCode | String | The correct version of the SortCode. This will be 6 digits long with no hyphens. It may differ from the original sortcode. |
| CorrectedAccountNumber | String | The correct version of the AccountNumber. This will be 8 digits long and in the form expected for BACs submission. |
| IBAN | String | The correctly formatted IBAN for the account. |
| Bank | String | The name of the banking institution. |
| BankBIC | String | The banking institution's BIC, also know as the SWIFT BIC. |
| Branch | String | The name of the account holding branch. |
| BranchBIC | String | The branch's BIC. |
| ContactAddressLine1 | String | Line 1 of the branch's contact address. NB: This is the address to be used for BACs enquiries and may be a contact centre rather than the branch's address. |
| ContactAddressLine2 | String | Line 2 of the branch's contact address. |
| ContactPostTown | String | The branch's contact post town. |
| ContactPostcode | String | The branch's contact postcode. |
| ContactPhone | String | The branch's contact phone number. |
| ContactFax | String | The branch's contact fax number. |
