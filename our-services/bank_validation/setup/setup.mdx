# Who should use this guide?
If you want to add Bank Validation to your website, this guide will get you up and running as quickly as possible.

This guide is broken up into the following sections:

- Choose which endpoint to use
- Create a new API key
- Understand your response fields
- Try it out

## Choose which endpoint to use
Bank Validation features four different endpoints, and which one you choose will be determined by what you're looking to achieve.

- **Interactive Validate (v2):** _individual_ validation for <mark>UK</mark> bank accounts
- **Batch Validate (v1):** _batch_ validation for <mark>UK</mark> bank accounts
- **International Interactive Validate (v1):** _individual_ validation for <mark>international</mark> bank accounts (excluding the US)
- **Interactive RetrieveBySortcode (v1):** _individual_ validation for <mark>UK</mark> bank accounts if you only have the sort codes to go on

## Create a new API key
Any Loqate API key will work with Bank Validation, however we recommend the following:

- Create a new key dedicated to Bank Validation, rather than reusing a key used for another service
- Create a **generic** API key

For more details, see our [Creating API Keys](https://www.loqate.com/developers/getting-started/creating-api-keys/) page.

## Understand your response fields
You can find a full breakdown of all available Bank Validation response fields in our API docs.
